# Random Introductory Notes

## Molecules

* The number of electrons in a stable molecule is even, and they are paired.
* All molecules around us are stable. 
* Free electrons are present in **Radicals**, a highly reactive product of photochemical reactions.
* A **photochemical** reaction is a reaction which involves sunlight.

## Concentration units

1 mg/L of water = 1 mg/1000g of water (recalling that 1L = 1000g of _distilled_ water).

### Accordingly: 
* PPM = part per _million_, i.e. 1/million of water = 1/10<sup>6</sup> = mg/L.
* PPB = part per _billion_, i.e. 1/billion of water = 1/10<sup>9</sup> = µg/L.
* PPT = part per _trillion_, i.e. 1/trillion of water = 1/10<sup>12</sup> = ng/L.

## Acid Rains

* Acid rains are caused NO<sub>x</sub>, SO<sub>x</sub> molecules released into the atmosphere as well as CO<sub>2</sub> present there.
* The concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> has been ↑ rapidly in the past few years due to it being the product of combustion reactions. It has exceeded 500ppm.
* Acid is formed when said molecules react with water (H<sub>2</sub>O), forming acid rain.

### Kinetic Decay

Every molecule in the atmosphere has a life cycle, which is the time it lives before reacting with other molecules to form byproducts. This is known as its **Kinetic Decay**.

## The Atmosphere

We will primarily focus on three layers of the atmosphere (top-bottom):

* **Mesosphere**: The external layer.

* **Stratosphere**: The Ozone layer.

* **Troposphere**: The human layer, i.e. the layer we live in.

### Ozone

**Ozone** (O<sub>3</sub>) is a corrosive molecule present in all layers of the atmosphere. It is most abundant in the stratosphere.

Ozone is the product of photochemical reactions.

* Ozone in the stratosphere is the "good" Ozone; it absorbs UV radiation from the sun which is dangerous to humans.
* However, Ozone (especially in the troposphere) is bad in increasing concentrations. Regardless of being harmful to breathe, it contributes to global warming.

#### Global Warming

* Sunlight is formed of visible light (most), IR light, and UV light.
* IR light is reflected back by the Earth's surface.
<br/><br/>
* Pollutants such as **CO<sub>2</sub>** and **O<sub>3</sub>** trap light in the Earth's atmosphere, preventing its reflection.
* This leads to heating up the planet => global warming.
