# Atoms and Elements

## Elements

* An element is a substance that cannot be broken down/chemically converted into simpler substances.
* 118 elements: 94 natural, 24 synthesized.
<br/><br/>
* A compound is bonding of multiple elements.

### Symbols of Elements

Symbols are an appreviation of the chemical name. They could be based on:

* English name
* Greek name
* Place of discovery
* Scientist name

#### Rules 
* One or two letters
* Capitalize first letter only

### Distribution of Elements

* Oxygen is the most abundant element in the Earth's crust.
* Naturally, the abundance of elements as well as the simplicity of their extraction plays a role in determining their rarity/cost.
* Other abdundant elements:
  * Silicon (Sand!)
  * Iron
  * Aluminium

## Particles

* A particle is the smallest unit of a chemical substance.
* A particle is made up of molecules, which in turn are made up of elements.
* A particle has 3 states: solid, liquid, and gas.

### Separation of substances

There are 2 techniques:

* **Physical**: does not change chemical composition, e.g. distillation, filtration.
* **Chemical**: results in new substances, e.g. hydrolysis.

## Atoms

* Building blocks of the physical world.
* Smallest unit of an element retaining an element's properties (protons, neutrons, electrons) do not.
* The diameter of an atom is about 0.1nm = 0.1 *  10<sup>-10</sup>m = 1Å (angstrom).
* Atoms could be for a simple chemical substance, such as a _copper wire_ (which contains only Cu atoms). However, it could also be for complicated chemical substances like _plastic_.

### Monomers and Polymers

* Plastic is a **polymer**.
* **Monomers** are small molecules which may be joined together in a repeating fashion to form more complex molecules called **polymers**.
* Monomers are usually organic materials.

## Structure of the Atom

### Bohr's Model

* An atom is an electrically neutral, **spherical** entity composed of positively charged central nucleus surrounded by electrons.
* An atom is composed of protons (+vely charged), electrons (-vely charged), and neutrons.
* The # of protons = # of electrons in a natural, stable atom.

### Atomic Symbol

<span style="font-size:2em"><sup>A</sup><sub>Z</sub>X</span> 

* X = element symbol
* A = Mass number = # of protons + # of neutrons
* Z = Atomic number = # of protons (= # of electrons (in a neutral atom))

e.g.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size:2em"><sup>12</sup><sub>6</sub>C</span> 

### Ions
* **Cation**: ion with positive charge.
If an atom loses one or more electrons it becomes a cation.
<br/>e.g.: Na => Na<sup>+</sup>

* **Anion**: ion with negative charge. If an atom gains one or more electrons it becomes an anion. 
<br/>e.g.: Cl => Cl<sup>-</sup>

### The Periodic Table

* Elements are sorted in increasing atomic number Z.

#### Families of Eements
* Some elements have similar properties, so they are grouped together by column in families/**groups**.
* This is based on their outer electron configuration (i.e. valence electrons).

#### Classification of Elements

Elements in the periodic table are classified into **metals**, **nonmetals**, and **metalloids**.

##### Characteristics of Metals
* Shiny.
* Conduct heat/electricity.
* Malleable.
* Tend to **lose** electrons.
##### Characteristics of Nonmetals
* Dull.
* Poor conductors.
* Nonmalleable.
* Tend to **gain** electrons.
##### Metalloids

Metalloids (also called transitive metals) have properties intermediate to metals and nonmetals.

#### Physical States of Elements

At room temperature (20 °C) and normal pressures, most elements are
solids, two are liquids (Hg and Br), and eleven are gases (H, N, O, F, Cl,
and the noble gases).

#### Molecular Elements

Some gases occur in nature as **diatomic molecules**. Each molecule of this element is formed of 2 atoms.<br/>H, N, O, F, Cl, Br, I.

### The Bohr Model: Revisited

* This model explains electron behavior.
* Electrons occupy orbits at fixed energies and fixed radii.
  * Each orbit accumudates a number of electrons.
  * The further away from the nucleus an orbit is, the higher amount of energy it has.
  * An electron occupying an orbit has a fixed energy level.
* Electrons are always spinning in motion. The energy of an electron is its **kinetic energy**.

#### Electron Configuration

* Electrons fill the lowest energy orbits available.
* Electrons _cannot_ exist in between orbits.
* Each orbit... 
  * is denoted an integer number n = 1, 2, 3... and is associated with a level of energy.
  * Can hold a maximum number of electrons e = 2n<sup>2</sup>. e = 2, 8, 18, ... for n = 1, 2, 3, ....
* Electrons can move from one orbit to another by exciting them, i.e. providing them with energy.
* Electrons do _not_ last n their excited state, thus any energy they gain is released as light or heat.

##### Redox Reactions

* Electrons play a central role in **redox reactions**: a type of chemical reaction that involves a transfer of electrons between two species.
* An **oxidation** reaction leads to a gain of electrons.
* A **reduction** reaction leads to a loss of electrons.

#### Reactivity 
* Atoms with full OUTER orbits are extremely **stable**. Thus, they do not perform reactions. <br/>These are known as the noble gases: He, Ne, Ar, ...
* Atoms with OUTER orbits which are not full undergo chemical reactions attempting to fill this orbit. 

#### Valence Electrons
* Electrons in the outer orbit are called the valence electrons.
* The kind of reactions elements undergo depend on their number of valence electrons.
