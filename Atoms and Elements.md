# Atoms and Elements

## Elements

* An element is a substance that cannot be broken down/chemically converted into simpler substances.
* 118 elements: 94 natural, 24 synthesized.
<br/><br/>
* A compound is bonding of multiple elements.

### Symbols of Elements

Symbols are an appreviation of the chemical name. They could be based on:

* English name
* Greek name
* Place of discovery
* Scientist name

#### Rules 
* One or two letters
* Capitalize first letter only

### Distribution of Elements

* Oxygen is the most abundant element in the Earth's crust.
* Naturally, the abundance of elements as well as the simplicity of their extraction plays a role in determining their rarity/cost.
* Other abdundant elements:
  * Silicon (Sand!)
  * Iron
  * Aluminium

## Particles

* A particle is the smallest unit of a chemical substance.
* A particle is made up of molecules, which in turn are made up of elements.
* A particle has 3 states: solid, liquid, and gas.

### Separation of substances

There are 2 techniques:

* **Physical**: does not change chemical composition, e.g. distillation, filtration.
* **Chemical**: results in new substances, e.g. hydrolysis.
